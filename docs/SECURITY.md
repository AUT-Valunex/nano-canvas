# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to keep the latest `main` branch and the most recent tagged release of Nano Canvas secure. Please report any vulnerability you discover, even if it affects older versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Email the maintainers at `valunex@ik.me` with the subject line `SECURITY: <short summary>`.
2. Include detailed reproduction steps, affected versions or commits, and any proof-of-concept code.
3. If the issue allows remote exploitation, please highlight the potential impact so we can prioritise appropriately.

We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** and provide a remediation timeline after investigation. Until the fix is released, please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly.

## Coordinated Disclosure

Once a fix is available, we will publish release notes and credit reporters who wish to be acknowledged. If you run a public deployment of Nano Canvas, subscribe to release notifications so you can patch promptly.
